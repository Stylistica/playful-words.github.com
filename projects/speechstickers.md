## SpeechStickers
#### PAST PROJECT
*Ivan Sysoev*

A major motivation for children to write is to leave their mark on the world. Speech Stickers provide them with this opportunity by moving outside of the screen. Children can use Speech Stickers to label their toys or compose letters to friends and family. A computer vision app on the smartphone will assist the child with this as well as with reading the messages of others.
