## SpeechBlocks
*Ivan Sysoev and Anneli Hershman*

[Currently in-progress]

SpeechBlocks is a smartphone app that allows children to explore spelling principles in an open-ended way. Children rearrange words by pulling them apart and putting them together with their fingers. Each word is then pronounced aloud by a speech synthesizer. This interaction was informed by current research findings in the area of early literacy learning. To alleviate the fear of making a mistake and support free and fun exploration, we excluded the notion of "right" and "wrong" from our design: nonsense words are pronounced just as well as regular words, much to children's amusement. While the app is intended to help children acquire basic reading and writing skills, it also turned out to be a medium for children's self-expression and creativity. We conducted several studies with children using SpeechBlocks and found that (a) the app facilitated childrenâ€™s engagement, sense of authorship and self-efficacy, and (b) it evoked significant amount of social interactions between children around literacy activities. Please [see our last paper](/papers/speechblocks-final.pdf) for details.

### Guided SpeechBlocks

In their play with SpeechBlocks, children often want to spell specific words. If adults are available, kids ask them for help. Such cases present valuable learning opportunities, as children skills grow largerly within the zone of proximate development - the range of activities that they cannot do on their own yet, but can do with some assistance. But what if there is no adult around willing to spare time and provide such assistance? We experiment with the app guiding the child on its own. It learns about the word that child wants to spell through one of the input channels (such as optical character recognition, as in the video below). It then helps to spell the word by highlighting the connection between sounds and letter combinations.

### Social SpeechBlocks: Word Pong
[Currently on hold]

We are experimenting with ways to incorporate social elements into our SpeechBlocks prototype to add meaningful ways for children to interact within the app. In this video, you can see children sending their words to one another. A character, which is the child's avatar on his/her friend phone, then pronounces the word aloud.
