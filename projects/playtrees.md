## PlayTrees
__Data-driven analysis of play using SpeechBlocks__

*Mina Soltengheis and Ivan Sysoev*

The rich, fine-grained data gathered from SpeechBlocks opens up unique opportunities to go beyond test results and look closely, progressively and longitudinally at the child’s learning process itself  and use the lens of data to study what playful learning looks like.

To reveal the stories hidden in the data, we processed the log files into a semantic/symbolic data structure called Play Trees.  Play Trees abstract the actions of merge, split, and speak and are used to visualize the process of word construction. 

The following video demonstrates the concept of  Play Trees  by visualizing a  sample story from the data.

We use the raw data and Play Trees to understand both what children are building and how they’re building it. We first want to understand whether the words created are sensible by looking at the directionality of the text, misspellings, the context in which they were created, the pronounceability, and instances of word or letter repetition, etc.
