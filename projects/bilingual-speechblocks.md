## Bilingual SpeechBlocks
*Juliana Nazar√© and Anneli Hershman*

It can be difficult for bilingual children to differentiate between two languages, especially ones with similar alphabets where letters may look the same but are pronounced differently (e.g. Spanish and English). Allowing children to tinker with pronunciation in both languages may help them distinguish between languages at the phonetic level. We build and did an exploratory pilot-test of Bilingual SpeechBlocks, where children can create any real or nonsense Spanish or English words and hear how they are pronounced differently in the two languages.
