## Research

### Framework of our social literacy learning machine
While there are a number of literacy technology solutions developed for individuals, the role of social—or networked—literacy learning is less explored. We believe that literacy is an inherently social activity that is best learned within a supportive community network including peers, teachers, and parents.

By designing an approach that is child-driven and machine-guided, we hope to empower human learning networks in order to establish an engaging and effective medium for literacy development while enhancing personal, creative, and expressive interactions within communities. We aim to create a network of learners to engage students from different communities in socially collaborative, self-expressive, and playful literacy learning opportunities via mobile devices.

### Projects
We are currently working on projects in three major areas of this social literacy learning machine: smart-expressive mediums, play analytics, and coaching roles and tools.


<div id="smart-expressive-mediums"></div>
#### SMART-EXPRESSIVE MEDIUMS
Fun, engaging experiences that tap into each child’s natural instincts to play and explore, while guiding children towards personalized learning outcomes based off of their play.

__[SpeechBlocks](/research-directions/speechblocks)__ - Learning literacy through free play

__[Bilingual SpeechBlocks](/research-directions/bilingual-speechblocks)__ - Helping bilingual Spanish-English speaking children differentiate between letter-to-sound mappings in their two languages through free play

__[PictureBlocks](/research-directions/pictureblocks)__ - Helping children playfully transform words into pictures!

__[StoryBlocks](/research-directions/storyblocks)__ - Scaffolding storytelling to connect children through self-expression

__[ShapeBlocks](/research-directions/shapeblocks)__ - Interactive, AI-assisted observatory for understanding shapes and geometry

<div id="play-analytics"></div>
#### PLAY ANALYTICS
Methods to analyze and visualize fine-grained logs of every touch interaction on our children's apps to help human analysts see intentional higher level patterns.

__[PlayTrees](/research-directions/playtrees)__ - Data driven analysis of play using SpeechBlocks


<div id="coaching-roles-and-tools"></div>
#### COACHING ROLES AND TOOLS
Developing tools that help a human coach analyze a child's play and connect with the child's caregiver on ways to support their child’s learning using our children's learning apps.

__[Family Learning Coach](/research-directions/family-learning-coach)__ -  Creating updates and activities for families on based their children’s wordplay

__[ChatterBox](/research-directions/chatterbox)__ - Speech synthesis in tutor mode
