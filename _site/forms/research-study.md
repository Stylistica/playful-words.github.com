### CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN NON-BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH

### Promoting Literacy Through Playful Words’ Apps and Tools for Children and Families,
### Phase 1
Your child is asked to participate in a research study conducted by Anneli Hershman, Juliana Nazare, Marc Exposito, Ivan Sysoev, Sneha Makini, Lauren Fratamico, Nazmus Saquib, and Deb Roy, from the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). The results of this study may be used in an academic paper or dissertation. Your child was selected as a possible participant in this study because they are between the ages of 4-10 years old. You should read the information below, and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to allow your child to participate.

#### PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL
Your child’s participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether your child will be in it or not. If you choose to allow your child to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw your child from the study at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind. The investigator may withdraw your child from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so. 

#### PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The study is designed to understand how we can improve our playful literacy learning apps, and then use the play data from these apps to help us build a supportive learning system and loops the family into the playful learning process.

#### PROCEDURES
If your child volunteers to participate in this study, we would first show them the app or tools, and how it works. We will then give your child a mobile phone, and ask your child to play freely, or to complete a certain task while playing with the app. Once they are finished playing, we will ask your child a few questions about their experience and preference. We may ask your child to help us think of new designs and ideas for our apps and games.

The study should take no more than 30 minutes per child.

#### POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
None.

#### POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
Potential benefits of this study for the child include having a fun experience playing with a game or app, and getting to try out new features.

#### PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION
None.

#### CONFIDENTIALITY
Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with your child will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. In addition, your information may be reviewed by authorized MIT representatives to ensure compliance with MIT policies and procedures.

Data will be collected through researcher notes and through the app, which is instrumented to record the clicks made within the phone’s application in log files on the phone (note: we do not record any clicks outside of the app). All subjects will be de-identified in both the notes and the app log files.

All notes and feedback questionnaires will be kept on paper and stored in a secure location (locked file cabinet) and any data we input into a password protected computer will be deidentified. Log files will also be stored on an encrypted, password protected computer.

We wish to use video recording in order to help us collect better observation data on how children use our apps and the dialogue that may occur during the study session. These videos are for research purposes only, and will not be viewed by anyone outside of the research study. No names or other personally identifying information (besides faces) will be associated with these video recordings. These video recordings will be encrypted and uploaded onto a password-protected computer, and only the researchers on this study will have access to this computer. Once these recordings are transcribed, they will be deleted. If you wish to view these videos, you may request access to them at any time. You also may ask to have them deleted at any time. You do not need to consent to video recordings in order to participate.
