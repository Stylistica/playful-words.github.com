<p><em>Ivan Sysoev and Anneli Hershman</em></p>

<p>SpeechBlocks is a self-expressive literacy app that helps young children explore alphabetic principles through manipulating letter blocks. Phonemes and words are heard when letter blocks are tapped, put together (blended into words), or pulled apart (segmented into sounds). There is no correct combination of letters, so children can create real and nonsense words. SpeechBlocks encourages children’s intrinsic motivation by avoiding extrinsic rewards such as points or prizes. Words from a “word shelf” and letters from a “letter shelf” serve as scaffolds that children can use and remix.</p>

<p>We are experimenting with ways to incorporate social elements into our SpeechBlocks prototype to add meaningful ways for children to interact within the app. In this video, you can see children sending their words to one another through characters.</p>
