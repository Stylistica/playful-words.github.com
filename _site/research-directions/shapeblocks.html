      <h2 id="shapeblocks">ShapeBlocks</h2>
<p><em>Nazmus Saquib</em></p>

<p>ShapeBlocks is a play analytics observatory that tracks, remembers, and aids players in building traditional LEGO-style structures. As players build a structure using these blocks, an underlying geometry engine analyzes the players’ moves and suggests next steps (if a target structure is provided). The players can see real-time updates of what they are building in 3D. Instead of only suggesting, the AI learns from the players’ moves and corrects itself through reinforcement learning. This essentially gives an opportunity for children and machines to learn shapes and geometry together.</p>

<p>Other use cases include urban design, and interactive strategy games and/or storytelling experiences that fuse the physical and virtual world together.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. The hardware is complete, and the AI tool and games are currently being built.</p>
