        <h2 id="privacy-policy-and-consent-to-participate-in-a-research-study">Privacy Policy and Consent To Participate in a Research Study</h2>

<p>We created SpeechBlocks so that children can explore the letters and sounds that comprise language through a playful learning experience. The purpose of this study is to help us understand how children and families use our app, SpeechBlocks in the home. We understand how important privacy is to our community, especially children and families. We wrote this privacy policy to explain what information we collect, how we use it, and what we’re doing to keep it safe. If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>.</p>

<h3 id="consent-to-participate-in-a-research-study">Consent to participate in a research study</h3>
<p>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to be in it or not. By accepting these terms on the SpeechBlocks app, you consent to be part of this study. If you choose to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind by emailing us at <a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>.</p>

<p>As a participant in this study, we ask that you, the parent, give us permission to collect information about how your child interacts with the SpeechBlocks app and send you confidential surveys about your and your child’s experiences with SpeechBlocks. You may also contact the research team for technical support throughout the study. All communication (e.g. surveys) will be sent to you in the form of emails. You will also receive text messages that contain coaching tips related to SpeechBlocks play. These will be sent 1-3 times per week. All coach communication is via text/SMS messages, and we ask that you communicate via text/SMS messages and/or phone calls when communicating about children’s specific play within the SpeechBlocks app, or in relation to the child’s progress. These will be sent 1-3 times per week. You may also receive brief, 15-minute check-in phone calls about your and your child’s experience with SpeechBlocks and the system, which would be twice over the eight weeks. Throughout anytime in the study, you are welcome to give feedback on your experiences via text/SMS message to a coach, or email to a researcher on the study. If you ever want to decrease or stop the amount of communication between you and the research team or coach, you can let the researchers know by email (<a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>). You can also choose to change your communication medium preference or opt-out of the study at any time without consequence, by emailing the researchers at <a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>. There will be no monetary compensation given for participation in this study. However, you will receive a children’s book for each survey you complete for each child in the study. If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please email the research team at <a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The duration of the study is eight weeks, but your child is welcome to continue playing with the SpeechBlocks app after the study is complete by downloading the beta version of the app on their personal Android device. We will collect the loaned android devices at the end of the eight weeks. Please note that we will still be collecting data on your child’s activity within SpeechBlocks after the study, unless you opt-out. However, you will not receive emails from the researchers or surveys after the eight week study, not any updates, such as coaching tips. Since we are looking to see how children play with the SpeechBlocks app in their home environments, there is no prescribed amount of play per day during the eight week study.</p>

<p>If you are borrowing an Android device from the Laboratory for Social Machines research group, you are not responsible for the use and care of the device during the study, but you are responsible for returning the phone at the end of the study. If the phone is lost or stolen during the study, please contact the research team immediately at <a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>. You will not be charged or responsible for replacing the device. If there is any damage to the device outside of regular use, please immediately contact the research team at <a href="mailto:aj@media.mit.edu">aj@media.mit.edu</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-information-does-speechblocks-collect">What information does SpeechBlocks collect?</h3>
<p>We collect some data on where on the screen you click and which parts of the SpeechBlocks app you use (called “click data”). This click data helps us figure out ways to improve the app, to understand how your child plays with the app, and to conduct research to find patterns about your child’s progress. Please note that all click data is de-identified and anonymous. The click data is associated with a unique device number, and does not contain any personally identifiable information about your child. The click data will be stored on a secure server (Amazon Web Services), and will only be accessed by the researchers on this project. All information will be stored for up to three years after the completion of this study. After three years, all data from this study will be deleted from the server.</p>

<p>We may also collect other information you (the parent) directly provide to the researchers, such as when you send the researchers an email, fill out a form, provide or request information, or otherwise submit information during the study. Such information may include personal information such as your name, email, and telephone number. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic and personal information you provide in connection with your participation in any non-anonymous surveys and other activities in connection with the Service. All email, SMS/Text message, and phone correspondence between you and the researchers or coaches will be immediately de-identified and stored on a password-protected computer. Please note that no personally identifying information will be linked with your child at all and the app will not collect any data outside of this study (i.e. unrelated calls or SMS, etc.).</p>

<p>Communication with the research team or coaches during the study may be recorded; however, any recordings will be de-identified and only accessible to the research team. You do not have to agree to these recordings in order for you to participate in the study and you may opt out of the recordings at any time.</p>

<p>Although SpeechBlocks uses an outside service provider, the Acapela Group, for speech synthesis, SpeechBlocks does not share any personally identifiable information it collects with the Acapela Group, and the Acapela Group does not collect any personal identifying information about you.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-speechblocks-team-use-the-information-it-collects">How does the SpeechBlocks Team use the information it collects?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We may use the information in research studies intended to improve our understanding of how people learn with SpeechBlocks. The results of this research are shared with educators and researchers through conferences, journals, and other publications.</li>
  <li>We analyze the information to understand and improve SpeechBlocks, such as determining which pre-made words are most popular, which sounds are most used, and how long users spend in the app.</li>
  <li>Other than the cases described above, we will never share personally identifiable information about you with any other person, company, or organization, except:
    <ul>
      <li>As required to comply with our obligations under the law.</li>
      <li>For technical reasons, if we are required to transfer the data on our servers to another location or organization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
