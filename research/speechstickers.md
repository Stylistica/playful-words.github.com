## SpeechStickers
#### PAST PROJECT
*Ivan Sysoev*

[Not currently in-progress]

A major motivation for children to write is to leave their mark on the world. SpeechStickers provide them with this opportunity by moving SpeechBlocks-type play outside of the screen. Children can use SpeechStickers to label their toys or compose letters to friends and family. A computer vision app on the smartphone will assist the child with this as well as with reading the messages of others.
