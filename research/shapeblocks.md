## ShapeBlocks
*Nazmus Saquib*

ShapeBlocks are instrumented blocks that track, remember, and aid players in building physical structures. As players build structures using these blocks, an underlying geometry engine analyzes the playersâ€™ moves and interactions to determine the structure stability. The players can see real-time updates of what they are building. The system can also analyze the compositionality of each structure to personalize the suggestion for next structures that can be built. Data collected from play traces can also inform parents and teachers about the patterns of exploration with these blocks.

Other use cases include urban design, music composition, and interactive strategy games and/or storytelling experiences that fuse the physical and virtual world together.
