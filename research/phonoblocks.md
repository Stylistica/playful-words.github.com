## PhonoBlocks
*Ivan Sysoev*

PhonoBlocks is an app similar in design and purpose to [SpeechBlocks](/research/speechblocks). However, the blocks in this design are not letters, but sounds of the language (phonemes). While the sound of a letter in English changes depending on the word the letter is in, phonemes behave consistently in every word. Therefore, it might be easier for children to master usage of phoneme-based blocks, opening the avenue for early "writing". Playing with phonemes is likely to help building phonological awareness (the ability to distinguish and manipulate the sounds within the words) - the key component of early literacy. When competence with phonemes is acquired, phoneme-to-letters correspondences may start to be introduced. PhonoBlocks is part of our exploration attempting to find out what designs facilitate early forms of meaningful writing.
